# Upfront Design Studio

Let's face it, The web is broken.

HTML/CSS were built in the 80s when the web was only somthing that researchers at universities used to share their research. CSS was built by a bunch of programmers who know very little about design techniques, and goes against many of the foundations of design.

We can fix it. Together.

Upfront seeks to rebuild the web in such a way that a designer can have the freedom they seek without getting entangled in the mess of programing.


## Revolutionary Changes

If all the web is, is displaying data from a database, and updating that data from interactions with an interface. Then lets make it feel that way.

Like many revolutionary ideas, the origins of this idea are not original. Only in bringing together many existing ideas is something revolutionary is created. So listed below are the existing products that we seek to bring inspiration from.

- Wrapping xhr requests into a consistent UI Interface
  - IFTTT
  - Postman
- Requested data presented in a format free of served syntax (JSON, XML, CSV, etc)
  - GraphQL
  - Pandas
  - AirTable
- Pages built in SVG instead of HTML to give more freedom to website design studios
  - InVision
  - Sketch
- All data on page is tied back to an easily modifiable state object
  - React
  - Redux
  - Angular
  - Vue
- Interaction Events and Triggers be handled through a Block Based Programming Language
  - Scratch
  - Unreal Engine
- Components of a website can be easily shared and improved upon in an open source library
  - npm
